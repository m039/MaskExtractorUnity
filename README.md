# MaskExtractorUnity
MaskExtractorUnity is a utility to extract some portion of an image by color in Unity.
# How to Use
In the picture below, you can see how you can specify diferrent colors to select some portion of an image (you may think of it as the magic wand in Photoshop). After you select all parts you're interested in, you may save it on a disk.

## Use Case
You may use this tool to cut some parts of an image and then recolor them in Unity. You can see an example in [SampleScene](Assets/MaskExtractor/_Scenes) or [ManExtractorAsset](Assets/MaskExtractor/Data).

This what you may do with the generated masks from the example.
